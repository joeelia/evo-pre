        "question": "What is Microneedling?",

      {
        "question": "What are the benefits of microneedling?",
        "answer": "Once the small wounds are created using the microneedling device, it stimulates your body to make more collagen and elastin, which heals your skin and gives an overall youthful appearance. In addition, it tightens the skin, reduces pore sizes, reduces fine lines and wrinkles as well as helps with pigmentation and uneven skin tone."

      {
        "question": "Can I get Microneedling without PRP?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You have the option to do microneedling therapy on its own. We use a serum prior to gliding the microneedle device across your face. Once done, all you have to do is let the skin heal properly while using adequate sunscreen if stepping outdoors. Optimal results will be apparent within a few days to a week."
