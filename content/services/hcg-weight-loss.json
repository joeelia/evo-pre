    "description": "HCG is a hormone that results in quick and effective weight loss while being on a very low calorie diet (while not getting hungry). It can be given via injection under the skin or taken by mouth. We offer a 23 day program and a 40 day program depending on the amount of desired weight loss. This service also comes with Vitamin B12 and MIC (aids in fat loss/ enhance metabolism) injections, as well as a simple to follow diet plan.",

        "question": "What is HCG Weight Loss?",
        "answer": "HCG is a hormone produced by placenta during pregnancy.\n\nDepending on the desired weight loss, it can be used for 23 days or 35 days for up to 20-40lbs weight loss. Even though you are on a very low calorie diet, your appetite will be suppressed as a result of the hormone.\n\nThis service comes with biweekly Vitamin B12, Vitamin B1-B6 and Fat Loss injections."

      {
        "question": "How long will the results last?",
        "answer": "That depends on you. There is more than one phase to the diet, with the first phase consisting of a very low calorie diet, minimal exercise, avoiding certain types of food and staying adequately hydrated. Over the next phase, calories are gradually increased while still limiting certain products and adding them later on during the last phase.\n\nThe whole point is not just a quick weight loss, but it is also lifestyle modification to allow for weight maintenance after the initial goal weight has been achieved."

      {
        "question": "If I gain some of the weight back, what are my options?",
        "answer": "You can do another round of HCG after a minimum of 6 week break. If you choose not to do so, our Registered Dietitian can help you get on an alternative track with monthly follow ups."
